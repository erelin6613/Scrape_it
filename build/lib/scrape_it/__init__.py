Note on additional .txt files in regex directory

						during the search of entity's name

						keywords it might contain (this is
						as needed for current task)

regex.txt - some regular expressions to search phone numbers;
			at the current time is not in use, phonenumbers
			package is used instead; one of improvements
			should be a workflow which would allow efficient
			and accurate phone matching with good filter
			pipeline from 'scraping trash'

address.txt - some regular expressions to match addresses,
				not perfect expesially given the diversity
				of different address formats accross 
				different countries
